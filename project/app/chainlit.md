# Ergobot: The [Ergo-log](https://www.ergo-log.com/) chatbot
[Ergo-log](https://www.ergo-log.com/) defines their site as:
 
"*Ergo-Log is a news site about legal and illegal ergogenic aids. When they work, ergogenic aids make us stronger, faster, cleverer and younger. They often have side effects, some of which we can live with, others not.*"

## Why Ergobot?
As a fan of [ergo-log](https://www.ergo-log.com/) and [ergogenics](https://www.ergogenics.org/index.html) I always wanted to be able to just ask questions related to their content

## How does it work?
I have scraped the archive of [Ergo-log](https://www.ergo-log.com/) and created a database. When asking Ergobot a question the following steps are taken:
1. Your question is used to retrieve relevant articles from the database of archived articles.
2. Your question, the documents and some instructions are sent to [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) who writes an answer based on the provided information.
3. The answer is returned within the chat window of Ergobot.
