    "result": "Green tea has been associated with several health benefits. Here are some of the potential benefits:\n\n1. Improved cardiovascular health: Green tea has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering LDL cholesterol levels and improving blood lipid profiles.\n\n2. Weight management: Green tea may aid in weight loss by boosting metabolism and increasing fat oxidation.\n\n3. Reduced risk of certain cancers: Some studies suggest that green tea consumption may lower the risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer.\n\n4. Enhanced brain function: The caffeine and other bioactive compounds in green tea can improve brain function, including mood, memory, and attention.\n\n5. Antioxidant properties: Green tea is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body against oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals.\n\n6. Improved insulin sensitivity: Green tea may help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n7. Anti-inflammatory effects: The polyphenols in green tea have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce inflammation and related diseases.\n\nIt's important to note that while these potential benefits have been observed in studies, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of green tea on human health. Additionally, individual results may vary, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.",

According to an epidemiological study from Tohuku University, each cup of green tea a day that elderly people drink reduces the chance of them developing complaints that limit their ability to function independently.\nStudy\nThe researchers followed a group of men and women in the town of Ohsaki, all of whom were 65 or older in 2006. They were looking for factors that reduce old people's likelihood of needing medical attention. According to the study, green tea is one of these factors.\nResults\nThe Japanese discovered that while green tea does not offer protection against prostate cancer [Br J Cancer. 2006 Aug 7; 95(3): 371-3.], it does reduce the chance of fatal pneumonia \n[Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 Sep; 90(3): 672-9.], psychological stress [Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 Nov; 90(5): 1390-6.] and of depression [Am J Clin Nutr. 2009 Dec; 90(6): 1615-22.].\nIt's hardly surprising that the green-tea drinkers lived longer than the non-tea drinkers in the study. [JAMA. 2006 Sep 13; 296(10): 1255-65.]\nThe Japanese have published the results of another study, in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, based on the data in the Ohsaki Cohort 2006 Study. This time they monitored 14,000 participants for a period of three years, and looked at whether green-tea drinkers developed complaints which made them require help less frequently. In the words of the study: the researchers looked at the relationship between drinking green tea and 'incident functional disability'.\nAs you can see, drinking five or more cups of green tea per day reduces the chance of some form of invalidity by almost 35 percent.\nConclusion\n\"Green tea consumption is inversely associated with incident functional disability\", the researchers conclude. \"Clinical trials are necessary to confirm the protective effect of green tea against functional disability.\"\nSource:\nAm J Clin Nutr. 2012 Mar;95(3):732-9.\n",

When a meta-study shows that green tea also improves cholesterol levels, we are not a bit surprised.\nStudy\nChinese cardiologists from Huazhong University of Science and Technology tracked 31 trials involving a total of 3,216 subjects. The researchers aggregated and re-analyzed the results of that study.\nResults\nThe researchers found no effect of green tea on the concentration of the 'good cholesterol' HDL and triglycerides. However, according to their meta-study, consumption of green tea had a positive effect on the level of 'bad cholesterol' LDL. Green tea lowered the LDL concentration by 4.55 points.\nThere was no effect of the amount of green tea on the LDL level.\nMechanism\nThe researchers suspect that green tea reduces the body's absorption of cholesterol, which in turn lowers synthesis of LDL.\nConclusions\n\"The results of this study indicate that green tea supplementation has a beneficial effect on [...] LDL cholesterol levels in both normal weight subjects and overweight/obese subjects\", the researchers write. \"Additional large prospective cohort studies are needed to provide a more definitive conclusion on the association between routine consumption of green tea and lipid metabolism\".\nSource:\nNutr J. 2020 May 20;19(1):48.\n",

            page_content="ects liver and kidneys, and extends life expectancy\nIf you ingest 300 mg of the tea flavonoid EGCG every day, you might live up to 14 percent longer. If, that is, you react in the same way as lab animals did for nutritionists at Harbin Medical University in China. The results of their experiments will be published soon in Aging Cell.\nTea, and green tea in particular, contains catechins such as catechin, epigallocatechin [EGC], epicatechin-gallate [ECG] and epigallocatechin-gallate [EGCG]. Researchers suspect that EGCG in particular is the reason why epidemiological and animal studies show that tea consumption extends life expectancy. For more of our posts on the life-extending properties of tea click here.\nRecent review articles suggest that substances like EGCG inhibit the activity of free radicals and inflammatory proteins such as TNF-alpha. [Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci. 2012;88(3):88-101.] As we age, we become more sensitive to damage from radicals, and inflammatory proteins such as TNF-alpha become more active. As a result the chance of crucial molecules in cells being damaged increases, and diseases such as cancer or diabetes are more likely to develop.\nAccording to a 2001 study, the average Dutchman consumes 50 mg catechins daily from drinking tea. [Eur J Clin Nutr. 2001 Feb;55(2):76-81.] The Chinese converted this level of consumption to an equivalent dose for rats, and arrived at 5 mg EGCG per kg bodyweight a day. For simplicity's sake they assumed that catechins and EGCG were interchangeable.\nWhen the researchers gave their lab animals 5 mg EGCG per kg/day nothing happened. So they increased the dose by a factor 5, and then they did obtain results. Rats given 25 mg EGCG per kg/day from the age of 2 months lived longer.\nThe average lifespan [actually the median lifespan] of the rats that were not given EGCG was 92.5 weeks. The average lifespan of the rats in the EGCG group was 105 weeks. So the rats in the EGCG group lived fourteen percent longer.\nEGCG had no effect on the rats' insulin levels or their blood pressure. The EGCG rats weighed slightly less than the control rats. Blood analysis revealed however that the liver and kidneys of the EGCG rats remained healthier longer than those of the control group.\nMicroscopic analysis of liver and kidney tissues after the rats had died confirmed this too. The Chinese measured the histological activity index for the liver and the tubular injury score for the kidneys. The higher the scores, the worse the condition of the liver and kidneys. The scores for the tissues in the EGCG rats were significantly lower than those of the tissues in the control group.\nThe Chinese think that EGCG kept the rats' liver and kidneys healthy by inhibiting TNF-alpha and activating SIRT1, thereby extending their lifespan. \"Our study suggests that long-term consumption of phytochemicals with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities could be beneficial in promoting health and extending lifespan\", they write.\nIf you weigh 80 kg, the human equivalent of the EGCG dose used in the study is about 320 mg per day. Products containing this amount can be found in any drugstore or supplements store.\nSource: \nAging Cell. 2013 Jul 8. doi: 10.1111/acel.12133.

Not a lot, just a little \x96 so that your excess fat just melts away without having to count calories. Researchers at Lund University in Sweden have made a discovery that might be of interest. They write in Nutrition Journal that you can boost the satiating effect of a meal by drinking a large cup of green tea at the same time.\nGreen tea & insulin\nGreen tea contains substances that enhance the effect of insulin. Epidemiological studies have shown that drinking green tea reduces the chance of developing diabetes-2 [Ann Intern Med. 2006 Apr 18; 144(8): 554-62.] and extracts of green tea boost sensitivity to insulin in human [Am J Clin Nutr. 2008 Mar;87(3):778-84.] and in-vitro studies.\nStudy\nThe researchers at Lund University were curious whether they could achieve the same effects by getting people to drink a cup of green tea with meals, so they did an experiment with 15 subjects aged 22-35. The Swedes hoped that drinking green tea would make the glucose and insulin levels of the subjects rise less quickly than normal after a meal. If this were the case green tea could help reduce the likelihood of diabetes developing.\nThe researchers gave their subjects a meal consisting of white bread and turkey on two occasions. On one occasion the subjects drank a cup of hot water with the meal, on the other occasion a 300 ml cup of green tea. The researchers used Sencha tea, a green tea from Japan.\nThey brewed 9 g dried sencha leaves for three minutes in 300 ml water at 85 degrees. The result was a cup of tea containing 80 mg caffeine, 26 mg epicatechin [EC], 90 mg epicatechin gallate [ECG] and 32 mg epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG].\nResults\nBut the green tea had virtually no effect on the insulin or glucose levels, the Swedes discovered. It did inhibit the rise in the insulin and glucose levels, but the effect was not statistically significant.\nWhat was statistically significant was the effect that green tea had on the feeling of satiety after the meal. This feeling was significantly higher ninety minutes after the meal. In addition, the subjects felt 'fuller' after drinking green tea with the meal.\nConclusion\nThis is an interesting discovery, according to the Swedes. If a bigger study using overweight subjects were to confirm these findings, then it may be possible to help fight fat by drinking green tea with meals.\nSource:\nNutr J. 2010 Nov 30;9:63.\n",
